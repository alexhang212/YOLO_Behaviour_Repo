Validation and grid search
==================

.. Here, I will introduce the validation and gridseach workflows, which was used to calculate all the evaluation metrics and optimize hyper parameters for the final inference. These steps highly relates to the type of data/ manual annotation you have, so will differ between each system.

Here, I will introduce the validation and grid search workflows. This will be different for each study system, and will depend on the format of the manual annotation you have. 
I will expand this page more in the future, but for now, you can refer to ``Code/6_SampleValidation.py`` and ``./Code/7_SampleGridSearch.py`` for sample code for running validation and the grid search algorithms in the Siberian Jay system.

If you are in need of urgent advice, you can shoot me an email :\)

This page will be written out in the coming weeks.
