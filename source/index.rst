Welcome to YOLO-Behaviour's documentation!
==========================================
Here are detailed documentation on how to implement the YOLO-Behaviour framework on your own data, throughout the examples below we will use the Siberian Jays as a sample video and case study. Before you start, please make sure all pacakges are installed and sample datasets are downloaded (see Intro and  installation page). 

For any questions/ bugs to scripts, feel free to raise a github issue or contact me! (hoi-hang.chan[at]uni-konstanz.de)
